{"name":"Wojtek Materka","tagline":"Corporate fortune teller, PhD, INSEAD MBA, Programmer and Designer","body":"I help people grow and design better lives in the digital world.\r\n\r\n### Story\r\nI started out as a web developer and UX Designer more than 15 years ago.  \r\nSoon I realised that to really design great customer experiences one needs to make decisions at the business model level. So I joined [mBank.pl](www.mbank.pl) as a product manager and grew with a very innovative challenger brand in what now is called the \"fintech\" space.\r\n\r\nI was propelled into a general management career culminating in a leadership role in an international expansion, managing portfolio of products and a marketing department. At the same time I wrote a PhD on the topic of trust in the digital economy and completed an MBA at [INSEAD](https://www.quora.com/topic/INSEAD).\r\n\r\nAfter 7+ years in leadership positions in a fast growth environment I moved to Australia. I started working in innovation and strategy space and discovered great potential in combining design thinking and classic strategy frameworks. I've worked with some great leaders on transforming their companies in face of disruption. \r\n\r\n### Current status\r\nWe are currently on a sabbatical, and based in Warsaw.\r\nMoving to London around April 2016\r\n\r\n### Current professional projects \r\n- Just completed a strategic futures project for a major global bank in London\r\n\r\n### Current personal projects \r\n- \"SugarWatch\": an app to help people cut down sugar consumption\r\n- \"How to design a good life\": a book on how to make better choices in life\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nYou can check up on what I am thinking about on [mediu.com](https://medium.com/prototype-life).
