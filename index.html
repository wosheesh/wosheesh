        <p>Since I was a kid I moved around and had to make sense of new contexts and places. I lived in countries like Poland, Japan, Czech Republic, France, Australia and now UK. I witnessed a nation change from a communist state to a free market economy, grew up in peaceful Western suburbia, and tasted intense Far East. These experiences have opened me to many different aspects of life and made me a keen student of people and human systems. </p>
<p>I have an unusual mix of backgrounds. I am an engineer, who started working as a designer and later became a consultant with an MBA from INSEAD, a top business school. I also completed a PhD on the topic of <i>Trust in the Digital Age</i>. I looked at how online technology impacts development of trust. What I found is that quality of communication and authenticity is as important as product features such as price. If you work in business, this insight can save you millions.</p>

<p>I also worked in digital financial services, innovation and management consultancies and business schools. I designed and launched multiple online products, lead an international expansion, built product and marketing teams in international setting. One of the companies I worked for grew to 4+ million clients across 3 countries.</p>

<p>These days I help leaders and organisations work with ambiguous and complex problems in space of growth and change. I do leadership development and coaching for executives dealing with disruption and transformation. My interests are on how organisational dynamics and technology impact leadership and design in organisations.</p>
