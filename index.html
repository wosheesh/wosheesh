<p>I completed a PhD on the topic of <i>trust in the digital age</i>. My research concentrated on how online technology impacts relationships with brands. What I found is that quality of communication is as important as product features, like price for example. This insight can save you millions.</p>

<p>I also worked in startups. I designed and launched multiple online products, lead an international expansion, built product and marketing teams in international setting. One of the companies I worked for grew to 4 million users across 3 countries.</p>

<p>These days I am a leadership and innovation consultant helping organisations facing ambiguous challenges. I help leaders who face a lot of complexity to see and think better in order to design meaningful futures.</p>
