        <p>What really shaped who I am is the diversity of places and people I encountered. Since I was very young we moved. I lived in countries like Poland, Japan, Czech Republic, France, Australia and now UK. I witnessed a nation change from a communist state to a free market economy, grew up in peaceful Western suburbia, and tasted intense Far East. These experiences have opened me to many different aspects of life and made me a keen student of people and human systems. </p>
<p>I trained as an engineer, worked as a designer, became a business executive and a consultant with an MBA from INSEAD. I also completed a PhD on the topic of <i>Trust in the Digital Age</i>. I worked in digital financial services, innovation and management consultancies and business schools. I designed and launched multiple online products, lead an international expansion, and consulted to global companies looking to create innovation cultures. All this has taught me that change is not really that difficult as they say.</p>

<p>These days I help leaders and organisations thrive in this complex and uncertain world. I do leadership development and coaching for executives dealing with disruption and transformation. My interests are on how organisational dynamics and technology impact leadership and design in organisations. But in essence I work with people who want to lead and grow.</p>
