        <p>Since I was a kid I moved around and had to make sense of new contexts and places. I lived in countries like Poland, Japan, Czech Republic, France, Australia and now UK. I witnessed a nation change from a communist state to a free market economy, I lived in peaceful Western suburbia, and grew up in the mysterious and intense Far East. This experiences have opened me to many different aspects of life and taught me to be a keen student of people and human systems. </p>
<p>I completed a PhD on the topic of <i>trust in the digital age</i>. My research concentrated on how online technology impacts development of trust and market relationships. What I found is that quality of communication and authenticity is as important as product features such as price. If you work in business, this insight can save you millions.</p>

<p>I also worked in startups. I designed and launched multiple online products, lead an international expansion, built product and marketing teams in international setting. One of the companies I worked for grew to 4+ million clients across 3 countries.</p>

<p>These days I help leaders and organisations work with ambiguous and complex problems in space of growth and change. I do leadership development and coaching for executives dealing with disruption and transformation in their professional and personal lives. My interests are on how organisational and group dynamics impact design in organisations.</p>
