<p>Since I was a kid I moved around and had to make sense of new contexts and places. I lived in countries like Poland, Japan, Czech Republic, France, Australia and now UK. I witnessed a nation change from a communist state to a free market economy, I lived in peaceful Western suburbia, and grew up in the mysterious and intense Far East.</p>
<p>These personal experiences have opened me to many different aspects of life and taught me to be a keen student of people and human systems. I have learned that developing one's voice is not a matter of confidence, but a matter of acceptance and self-knowledge. But I have also learned that we are not just one voice - we have multiple identities, often paradoxically opposing but also continuously emerging.</p>

<p>I completed a PhD on the topic of <i>Trust in Digital Age</i>. My research concentrated on how online technology impacts development of trust and relationships. What I found is that authenticity and truth will get you much further than the most elaborate social media effort. </p>

<p>I also worked for fast growing digital companies. I designed and launched multiple online products, lead an international expansion, built product and marketing teams in international setting and advised to multiple businesses in the digital transformation.</p>

<p>These days I help leaders and organisations work with ambiguous and complex problems in context of uncertainty. I offer leadership development and coaching for executives dealing with disruption and transformation in their professional and personal lives. My interests are on how we develop as leaders in face of increasingly complex and uncertain world.</p>
