        <h3>Story</h3>

        <p>From an early age I moved around the world and had to make sense of new contexts and places. I lived and worked in over six different countries across three continents. I witnessed a nation change from a communist state to a free market economy, I lived in peaceful Western suburbia, and grew up in the intense Far East.</p>

        <p>These personal experiences have challenged me to become a keen student of people and human systems in context of a world that's always changing. In my own journey of development I found love and meaning in developing others.</p>

        <p>I completed a PhD on the topic of <i>Trust in Digital Age</i>. I also worked for fast growing digital companies. I designed and launched multiple online products, lead an international expansion, built product and marketing teams and advised to multiple businesses undergoing transformation.</p>

        <p>I help leaders and organisations see, think and act in context of uncertainty. I offer leadership development, consulting and coaching for executives dealing with disruption and transformation in their professional and personal lives.</p>
